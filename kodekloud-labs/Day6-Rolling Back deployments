Earlier today, the Nautilus DevOps team deployed a new release for an application. However, a customer has reported a bug related to this recent release. Consequently, the team aims to revert to the previous version.


There exists a deployment named nginx-deployment; initiate a rollback to the previous revision.

Sometimes, you may want to rollback a Deployment; for example, when the Deployment is not stable, such as crash looping. 
By default, all of the Deployment's rollout history is kept in the system .
so that you can rollback anytime you want (you can change that by modifying revision history limit).

Now you've decided to undo the current rollout and rollback to the previous revision:

kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment

Alternatively, you can rollback to a specific revision by specifying it with --to-revision:

kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=2
Check if the rollback was successful and the Deployment is running as expected, run:

kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment
