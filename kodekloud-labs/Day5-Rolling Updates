An application currently running on the Kubernetes cluster employs the nginx web server. The Nautilus application development team has introduced some recent changes that need deployment. They've crafted an image nginx:1.19 with the latest updates.


Execute a rolling update for this application, integrating the nginx:1.19 image. The deployment is named nginx-deployment.

Ensure all pods are operational post-update.


Steps to follow:-
---------------
A Deployment's rollout is triggered if and only if the Deployment's Pod template (that is, .spec.template) is changed, for example if the labels or container images of the template are updated. 
Other updates, such as scaling the Deployment, do not trigger a rollout.

you can edit the Deployment and change .spec.template.spec.containers[0].image from nginx:1.16 to nginx:1.19:

kubectl edit deployment/nginx-deployment

change the image tag.

The output is similar to:

deployment.apps/nginx-deployment edited.

To see the rollout status, run:

kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment

The output is similar to this:

Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
or
deployment "nginx-deployment" successfully rolled out

Run kubectl get rs to see that the Deployment updated the Pods by creating a new ReplicaSet and scaling it up to 3 replicas, as well as scaling down the old ReplicaSet to 0 replicas.

kubectl get rs

To see about your deployments

Run the below command

kubectl describe deployments nginx-deployment
